Here’s a concise overview of how DSPy optimization with BootstrapFewShot works:
DSPy Optimization with BootstrapFewShot
Purpose: Improves a DSPy module (e.g., a predictor) by automatically generating and selecting high-quality few-shot examples to include in its prompt.
Inputs:
Module: The DSPy module to optimize (e.g., SimplePipeline).
Trainset: A small set of examples with inputs and (optionally) expected outputs.
Metric: A function scoring how well the module’s predictions match desired outcomes (e.g., accuracy or rating).
Process:
Generate Outputs: The module processes the trainset inputs to produce candidate outputs.
Evaluate: The metric scores each output (e.g., 0-1 scale).
Select: Picks the best-scoring input-output pairs (e.g., top 3 by metric).
Bootstrap: Adds these pairs as few-shot examples to the module’s prompt.
Recompile: Updates the module with the new prompt for better performance.
Output: An optimized module that leverages the selected examples to guide future predictions.
Key Feature: Self-improving—uses the module’s own outputs to teach itself, no external gold standard required if outputs are scored well.
Example:
Trainset: [{"input": "What’s 2+2?", "output": "4"}].
Metric: 1.0 if output matches "4".
Result: Adds Input: What’s 2+2? Output: 4 to the prompt, improving similar queries.
It’s simple, effective, and focuses on leveraging a module’s own capabilities to enhance itself with minimal data.
Below are concise code examples showing how DSPy optimization with BootstrapFewShot works, tailored to your dspy_agent/ setup. These examples use your existing files (pipeline.py, rating.py, optimizer.py) and demonstrate optimizing a module step-by-step.
1. Basic Example: Optimizing SimplePipeline
This example optimizes SimplePipeline to answer questions better using BootstrapFewShot.
Code
python
# In dspy_agent/optimizer.py or a standalone script
import dspy
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot
from .pipeline import SimplePipeline
from .rating import RatingModule

# Define a simple trainset
trainset = [
    dspy.Example(input="What is 2+2?", output="4"),
    dspy.Example(input="What is the capital of France?", output="Paris")
]

# Configure the language model
lm = dspy.LM("deepseek/deepseek-chat")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

# Initialize modules
pipeline = SimplePipeline()
rating_module = RatingModule()

# Define a metric
def metric(example, pred):
    # Use RatingModule to score the prediction
    score = rating_module(example.input, pred.output, "accuracy")
    return score / 9.0  # Normalize to 0-1

# Optimize with BootstrapFewShot
bootstrapper = BootstrapFewShot(metric=metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=2)
optimized_pipeline = bootstrapper.compile(pipeline, trainset=trainset)

# Test the optimized pipeline
result = optimized_pipeline("What is 3+3?")
print(result)  # Should output something like "6" if optimized well
What Happens:
BootstrapFewShot runs pipeline on the trainset.
Scores outputs (e.g., "4" for "What is 2+2?") using rating_module.
Keeps the top 2 examples (e.g., "2+2=4", "France=Paris") if they score high.
Adds them to pipeline’s prompt for better future predictions.
2. Example with Your Existing PipelineOptimizer
This modifies your optimizer.py to use BootstrapFewShot as it already does, but I’ll show it explicitly with a concrete case.
Code (Existing optimize Method)
python
# dspy_agent/optimizer.py (partial edit for clarity)
def optimize(self, task: str, criterion: str, num_iterations: int = 1, progress_callback=None) -> SimplePipeline:
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        examples = self.generate_examples(task, criterion, num_examples=3)
        examples.sort(key=lambda x: x["rating"], reverse=True)
        top_examples = examples[:2]  # Take top 2
        
        bootstrapper = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(
            metric=lambda ex, pred: self.rating_module(ex["input"], pred.output, criterion) / 9.0
        )
        train_data = [{"input": ex["input"], "output": ex["output"]} for ex in top_examples]
        self.pipeline = bootstrapper.compile(self.pipeline, trainset=train_data)
        
        if progress_callback:
            progress_callback()
    return self.pipeline

# Usage
optimizer = PipelineOptimizer(model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat")
optimized = optimizer.optimize("Answer math questions", "accuracy")
print(optimized("What is 5+5?"))  # Might output "10"
What Happens:
Generates examples like "2+2=4", "3+3=6".
Rates them with RatingModule.
Bootstraps the top 2 into the prompt, improving math answers.
3. Optimizing with Simulated Data
This simulates a scenario where the pipeline generates its own outputs to bootstrap.
Code
python
# Standalone script or in optimizer.py
import dspy
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot
from .pipeline import SimplePipeline
from .rating import RatingModule

# Simulated inputs (no outputs provided)
trainset = [
    dspy.Example(input="What’s the weather like today?"),
    dspy.Example(input="How many days in a week?")
]

lm = dspy.LM("deepseek/deepseek-chat")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

pipeline = SimplePipeline()
rating_module = RatingModule()

def metric(example, pred):
    # Simple metric: length check as a proxy for quality
    score = rating_module(example.input, pred.output, "relevance")
    return score / 9.0

bootstrapper = BootstrapFewShot(metric=metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=2)
optimized_pipeline = bootstrapper.compile(pipeline, trainset=trainset)

# Test
print(optimized_pipeline("What’s the time?"))
What Happens:
pipeline generates outputs (e.g., "Sunny", "7").
metric scores them (e.g., based on relevance).
Best outputs (e.g., "7" for "days in a week") become examples in the prompt.
Key Points
BootstrapFewShot: Takes inputs, generates outputs, scores them, and adds high-scoring pairs to the prompt.
Metric: Critical for success—here, RatingModule normalizes scores to 0-1.
Output: The optimized module uses these examples to guide future predictions.
These examples show how BootstrapFewShot can work with your setup—simple, practical, and reusable! Let me know if you want more specific tweaks.

 To make each rating an individual output field in the RatingTask signature, we’ll update dspy_agent/rating.py to explicitly define accuracy, clarity, and relevance as separate OutputFields instead of a single JSON object. This allows the LLM to generate distinct scores for each criterion, which we can then average in the RatingModule. Here’s how to do it concisely:
Updated Approach
RatingTask: Define three output fields (accuracy, clarity, relevance) instead of one ratings field.
RatingModule: Compute the average of these fields directly from the prediction.
Usage: Integrate with your UnifiedModule loop in cli.py, keeping the rest of the system intact.

            return 5.0  # Default if parsing fails


Key Points
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch: Likely improves prompts by testing random example sets, selecting the best based on a metric. It seems effective for exploring various prompt configurations.
MIPROv2: Research suggests it optimizes instructions and examples using Bayesian methods, potentially enhancing prompt quality. It’s designed for complex tasks, possibly outperforming simpler optimizers.
Optimizing Instructions Only: Both can focus on instructions by adjusting settings, like using instructions_only=True for MIPROv2, though BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch may need custom metrics.
Auto Setting: The evidence leans toward it meaning default parameters, enabling automatic optimization without manual tuning, simplifying usage for both optimizers.
Direct Answer
Overview of BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch extends the basic BootstrapFewShot optimizer by applying it multiple times with random search over generated demonstrations. It evaluates different combinations of few-shot examples, selecting the best program based on a provided metric. This approach is useful for exploring a variety of example sets to find the optimal prompt configuration, potentially improving performance on tasks where the right examples matter.
Overview of MIPROv2
MIPROv2, or Multiprompt Instruction Proposal Optimizer Version 2, is a DSPy optimizer that generates both instructions and few-shot examples for each step of the pipeline. It uses Bayesian Optimization to search over the space of generation instructions and demonstrations, aiming to find the best combination for high-quality outputs. It’s particularly effective for complex tasks, offering a data-aware and demonstration-aware approach.
Optimizing Instructions Only
To optimize instructions only, you can configure MIPROv2 with instructions_only=True, focusing solely on refining the prompt text without adding examples. For BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, while it primarily handles examples, you can emphasize instruction tuning by using a custom metric that prioritizes instruction quality, though this requires more manual setup. Both approaches allow you to tailor the optimization process to your needs.
Auto Setting Explained
The "auto" setting likely refers to using the default parameters for these optimizers, enabling them to run automatically without manual tuning. For BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, this means default values like max_bootstrapped_demos=4 and max_labeled_demos=4. For MIPROv2, it includes defaults like minibatch=True for efficient exploration, simplifying the optimization process and making it accessible for users without deep configuration knowledge.
An unexpected detail is that MIPROv2’s Bayesian approach might explore counterintuitive instructions, like prompts with unexpected themes, which could enhance performance in surprising ways, as seen in some research (Optimize LLM with DSPy).
Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of DSPy Optimizers
Introduction
DSPy, a framework for programming rather than prompting language models, offers optimizers to enhance prompt and weight tuning for AI systems. This note explores two key optimizers, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch and MIPROv2, focusing on their mechanisms, how to optimize instructions only, and the implications of the "auto" setting. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and research, ensuring a comprehensive understanding as of March 21, 2025.
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch: Mechanism and Usage
BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch extends the BootstrapFewShot optimizer by applying it multiple times with random search over generated demonstrations. It aims to select the best program by evaluating various combinations of few-shot examples using a provided metric. According to Optimizers - DSPy, it mirrors BootstrapFewShot parameters like max_bootstrapped_demos (maximum number of bootstrapped demonstrations) and max_labeled_demos (maximum number of labeled demonstrations from the trainset), with an additional num_candidate_programs parameter to specify the number of random programs evaluated.
The process involves generating candidate few-shot examples, evaluating multiple random combinations with the metric, and selecting the optimal set. This is particularly useful for tasks where the right set of examples significantly impacts performance, as noted in Understanding Optimizers in DSPy. For instance, experiments showed accuracy improvements from 70-85% on code generation benchmarks, with additional gains from random search (DSPy based Prompt Optimization).
To optimize instructions only, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch can be adapted by using a custom metric that prioritizes instruction quality over example selection, though this requires manual configuration. The default parameters, such as max_bootstrapped_demos=4, enable automatic operation, aligning with the "auto" setting, which simplifies usage by avoiding manual tuning (BootstrapFewShot | DSPy).
MIPROv2: Mechanism and Usage
MIPROv2, or Multiprompt Instruction Proposal Optimizer Version 2, is a state-of-the-art optimizer in DSPy that generates both instructions and few-shot examples for each pipeline step. It employs Bayesian Optimization to search over the space of generation instructions and demonstrations, as detailed in MIPROv2 Optimizer - DSPy. This process involves running multiple trials, evaluating prompts over a validation set, and refining the best combination, with default settings like minibatch=True for efficient exploration/exploitation.
MIPROv2 is data-aware and demonstration-aware, using a dataset summarizer to understand the task, making it suitable for complex pipelines (The power of MIPROv2). It can optimize instructions by focusing on prompt refinement, and setting instructions_only=True ensures it prioritizes instruction generation without adding examples, as seen in Optimize LLM with DSPy. The "auto" setting here likely refers to default configurations like minibatch=True and num_trials=10, enabling automatic optimization without manual intervention (Grokking MIPROv2).
Optimizing Instructions Only
For BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, optimizing instructions only requires a custom metric that evaluates instruction quality, as it primarily focuses on few-shot examples. This might involve adjusting teacher_settings to emphasize prompt generation, though documentation suggests it’s less direct (BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch - DSPy). For MIPROv2, setting instructions_only=True explicitly focuses on instruction tuning, leveraging its Bayesian approach to refine prompts, which is more straightforward (Optimizers - DSPy).
Auto Setting: Implications
The "auto" setting, likely referring to default parameters, simplifies optimizer usage by automating configuration. For BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, defaults include max_bootstrapped_demos=4 and max_labeled_demos=4, enabling automatic example selection (BootstrapFewShot | DSPy). For MIPROv2, defaults like minibatch=True and automatic trial management reduce manual effort, as seen in MIPROv2 Optimizer - DSPy. This automation is crucial for users seeking efficiency, though it may limit fine-tuning for specific tasks.
